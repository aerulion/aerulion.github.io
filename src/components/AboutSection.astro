                        My name is aerulion, I'm a 26-year-old <strong>Java developer from Germany</strong> with a
                        passion for creating innovative <strong>Minecraft experiences</strong>. I specialize in
                        developing <strong>custom gameplay systems</strong> that push the boundaries of what's
                        possible in Minecraft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the <strong>lead developer</strong> at <a
                            href="https://corpium.net/"
                            class="modern-link"
                            rel="noopener"
                            target="_blank"
                    >Corpium</a>, one of the oldest German Minecraft servers, I design and maintain sophisticated
                        <strong>plugin ecosystems</strong> that manage many new features and complex game mechanics.
                        My work focuses on creating seamless, <strong>performance-optimized solutions</strong> that
                        enhance player experience while maintaining the vanilla look and feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My expertise ranges from low-level Java optimization to high-level system design, with
                        particular strengths in <strong>database architecture</strong> and <strong>scalable plugin
                        development</strong>. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code that will
                        withstand the test of time and the growth of player bases.
